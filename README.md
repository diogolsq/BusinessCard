# Digital Business Card
### Quick and easy
In business meetings you see everyone giving business cards, but how many people actually use them for a follow-up contact and 
how many just end up sitting on a desk never used, or even going in the trash?

I have created a simple online business card as another alternative, a quick and easy way to increase networks via a QR code.
